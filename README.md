# Prison_Covid_USA_2022: Analysis of Covid-19 Pandemic in American Prisons
This project aimed to gain a deeper insight in the evolution of the implemented policies and the response of the prisons in the USA on the COVID crisis: 
 - Which state implemented the greatest number of policies? 
 - Is the number of policies implemented related to the prison budget? 
 - Which is the most effective policy in influencing the evolution of cases?
 
# Methodology
To gain a better insight in the importance of the policies implemented per state and per quarter and how similar the states are compared to each other: 
 - Neo4j was used to create the graph and NEuler was used for the algorithms.
 
To understand the importance of the implemented policies and prison characteristics on the inmate cases:
 - Tree-based machine learning models are trained and shapley values are obtained for feature importance analysis.
